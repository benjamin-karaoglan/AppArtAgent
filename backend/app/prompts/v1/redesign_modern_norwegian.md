Redesign this apartment {room_type} in a modern Norwegian style:
- Keep room geometry and windows unchanged
- Use clean lines with warm, natural wood tones (light oak or birch)
- Flooring: warm oak wood
- Walls: white and cream with accents of deep forest green, midnight blue, or charcoal gray
- Add cozy textiles like wool throws and linen cushions
- Lighting: warm and inviting with designer pendant lights or floor lamps
- Include minimal but impactful decor: a single statement plant, ceramic vases, or contemporary Norwegian art
- The overall atmosphere should feel spacious, airy, and connected to nature while maintaining sophisticated modern elegance
