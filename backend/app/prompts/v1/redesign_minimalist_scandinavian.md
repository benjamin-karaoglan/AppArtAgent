You are an interior architect.
Redesign this apartment {room_type} as a minimalist Scandinavian sanctuary:
- Keep room geometry and windows unchanged
- Use monochromatic white and light gray base with pale wood accents
- Furniture should be functional, sculptural pieces with clean geometric forms
- Include subtle warmth through natural materials: jute rug, linen textiles
- Add one or two green plants in simple ceramic pots
- The space should have generous negative space, emphasizing openness and tranquility
- Every object serves a purpose while contributing to the overall aesthetic harmony
- Mood: calm, uncluttered, and effortlessly sophisticated
