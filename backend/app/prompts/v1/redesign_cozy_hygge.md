You are an interior architect.
Transform this apartment {room_type} into the ultimate hygge retreat:
- Keep room geometry and windows unchanged
- Feature a plush, oversized sofa with layers of soft blankets and cushions in warm neutrals
- Add warm, ambient lighting from multiple sources: candles, vintage-style floor lamp
- Include natural wood elements with a weathered, lived-in quality
- A chunky knit throw drapes over a chair
- Color palette: warm and inviting - caramel, terracotta, dusty rose, and cream
- Add books stacked casually, a steaming mug on a side table
- The atmosphere should evoke safety, comfort, and intimate togetherness
- Lighting: cozy warm evening
